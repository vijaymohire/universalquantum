FTQC related files that will allow for smooth transition from NISQ era QC to FTQC computers. This will use a blend of various technologies like DNA Computing, DNA Storage, QAI, QML, Spintronics, Optics, Photon based entangled qubits, Teleportation using max entangled qubits and Traversable wormhole, room temperature qubit generation, long coherence using DNA, synthetic biology, etc
