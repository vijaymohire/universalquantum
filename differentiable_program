QC differentiable program: to abstract libraries used for compilation or interpretation of QCircuit. In this we have generic graph nodes that can hold various QC elements and differentated
across various target platforms or runtimes from different vendors. The source QCircuit can be abstracted and a set of generic or universal software gates can be used as placeholders that have 
a good counterpart across different target QC platforms
