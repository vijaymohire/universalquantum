QC algorithms block: Allows hybrid algos to mingle and develop code.
This module offers software universal set and gates that are good at simulation of real gates and algos. These are later mapped to real qubit based gates. These are generic in nature and
are part of the universal Q Computer architecture. There are additional elements that are required like ancillas, ansatz, classical and quantum gate hybrids, classical abd quantum algorithsm and
helper utilites that are required to compile and run a algorithm in few seconds time limited by the quantum memory.
