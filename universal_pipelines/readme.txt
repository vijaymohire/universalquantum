QC Execution pipelines: Hybrid elements for local and distributed operations, quantum principles, classical and quantum workload, security mgt. We design various pipelines and variants that allow for execution of various types of QC programs in a unified model.
  These can be related to data, features, logical qubits or any quantum related operations including classical measurements etc
